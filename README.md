# 🐍 100 Days of Python Bootcamp – Angela Yu Edition 🎓

Welcome to my chaotic (but educational) journey through the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu** – the course where bugs are friends, semicolons are illegal, and coffee is your only debugger. ☕💻

## 🚀 What’s This?

This repo is where I dump—uhh, I mean *organize*—all my projects, mini-apps, and "why-is-this-not-working" moments from Angela Yu’s fantastic Python Bootcamp on Udemy.

Yes, I *could* have kept it all on my local machine, but where’s the thrill in that? Now the whole internet can witness my slow descent into Python madness. 🧠🐍

## 📅 Progress Tracker

| Day | Project | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|
| 001 | Band Name Generator | ✅ Named 6 bands no one asked for |
| 002 | Tip Calculator | ✅ Math, but make it painful |
| 003 | Treasure Island Game | ✅ Died 7 times before lunch |
| ... | ... | 🚧 Brain not found |
| 100 | Final Project | 🔮 Coming (eventually) |

> 🧠 "Why learn Python in 100 days?"
> Because 365 was too intimidating and 30 wasn’t enough to feel the panic.

## 🧪 What’s Inside?

- A folder for each day/project
- Code that probably works™
- Comments ranging from helpful to "what was I thinking?"
- Occasional memes hidden in code comments

## 🐞 Disclaimer

- I am not responsible for any lost brain cells while reviewing this code.
- May cause sudden urges to refactor everything.
- Side effects include: joy, confusion, and excessive use of `print()` for debugging.
